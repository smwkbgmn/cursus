/*
15.5.1. 400 Bad Request
The 400 (Bad Request) status code indicates that the server cannot or will not
process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error
(e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive
request routing).

15.5.4. 403 Forbidden
The 403 (Forbidden) status code indicates that the server understood the request
but refuses to fulfill it. A server that wishes to make public why the request
has been forbidden can describe that reason in the response content (if any).

If authentication credentials were provided in the request, the server considers
them insufficient to grant access. The client SHOULD NOT automatically repeat
the request with the same credentials. The client MAY repeat the request with
new or different credentials. However, a request might be forbidden for reasons
unrelated to the credentials.

An origin server that wishes to "hide" the current existence of a forbidden
target resource MAY instead respond with a status code of 404 (Not Found).

15.5.5. 404 Not Found
The 404 (Not Found) status code indicates that the origin server did not find a
current representation for the target resource or is not willing to disclose
that one exists. A 404 status code does not indicate whether this lack of
representation is temporary or permanent; the 410 (Gone) status code is
preferred over 404 if the origin server knows, presumably through some
configurable means, that the condition is likely to be permanent.

A 404 response is heuristically cacheable; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by
the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of
[CACHING]).

15.5.6. 405 Method Not Allowed
The 405 (Method Not Allowed) status code indicates that the method received in
the request-line is known by the origin server but not supported by the target
resource. The origin server MUST generate an Allow header field in a 405
response containing a list of the target resource's currently supported methods.

A 405 response is heuristically cacheable; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by
the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of
[CACHING]).

15.5.7. 406 Not Acceptable
The 406 (Not Acceptable) status code indicates that the target resource does not
have a current representation that would be acceptable to the user agent,
according to the proactive negotiation header fields received in the request
(Section 12.1), and the server is unwilling to supply a default representation.

The server SHOULD generate content containing a list of available representation
characteristics and corresponding resource identifiers from which the user or
user agent can choose the one most appropriate. A user agent MAY automatically
select the most appropriate choice from that list. However, this specification
does not define any standard for such automatic selection, as described in
Section 15.4.1.

15.5.9. 408 Request Timeout
The 408 (Request Timeout) status code indicates that the server did not receive
a complete request message within the time that it was prepared to wait.

If the client has an outstanding request in transit, it MAY repeat that request.
If the current connection is not usable (e.g., as it would be in HTTP/1.1
because request delimitation is lost), a new connection will be used.

15.5.10. 409 Conflict
The 409 (Conflict) status code indicates that the request could not be completed
due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource. This code is
used in situations where the user might be able to resolve the conflict and
resubmit the request. The server SHOULD generate content that includes enough
information for a user to recognize the source of the conflict.

Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request. For example, if
versioning were being used and the representation being PUT included changes to
a resource that conflict with those made by an earlier (third-party) request,
the origin server might use a 409 response to indicate that it can't complete
the request. In this case, the response representation would likely contain
information useful for merging the differences based on the revision history.

15.5.11. 410 Gone
The 410 (Gone) status code indicates that access to the target resource is no
longer available at the origin server and that this condition is likely to be
permanent. If the origin server does not know, or has no facility to determine,
whether or not the condition is permanent, the status code 404 (Not Found) ought
to be used instead.

The 410 response is primarily intended to assist the task of web maintenance by
notifying the recipient that the resource is intentionally unavailable and that
the server owners desire that remote links to that resource be removed. Such an
event is common for limited-time, promotional services and for resources
belonging to individuals no longer associated with the origin server's site. It
is not necessary to mark all permanently unavailable resources as "gone" or to
keep the mark for any length of time -- that is left to the discretion of the
server owner.

A 410 response is heuristically cacheable; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by
the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of
[CACHING]).

15.5.12. 411 Length Required
The 411 (Length Required) status code indicates that the server refuses to
accept the request without a defined Content-Length (Section 8.6). The client
MAY repeat the request if it adds a valid Content-Length header field containing
the length of the request content.

15.5.13. 412 Precondition Failed
The 412 (Precondition Failed) status code indicates that one or more conditions
given in the request header fields evaluated to false when tested on the server
(Section 13). This response status code allows the client to place preconditions
on the current resource state (its current representations and metadata) and,
thus, prevent the request method from being applied if the target resource is in
an unexpected state.

15.5.14. 413 Content Too Large
The 413 (Content Too Large) status code indicates that the server is refusing to
process a request because the request content is larger than the server is
willing or able to process. The server MAY terminate the request, if the
protocol version in use allows it; otherwise, the server MAY close the
connection.

If the condition is temporary, the server SHOULD generate a Retry-After header
field to indicate that it is temporary and after what time the client MAY try
again.

15.5.15. 414 URI Too Long
The 414 (URI Too Long) status code indicates that the server is refusing to
service the request because the target URI is longer than the server is willing
to interpret. This rare condition is only likely to occur when a client has
improperly converted a POST request to a GET request with long query
information, when the client has descended into an infinite loop of redirection
(e.g., a redirected URI prefix that points to a suffix of itself) or when the
server is under attack by a client attempting to exploit potential security
holes.

A 414 response is heuristically cacheable; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by
the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of
[CACHING]).

15.5.16. 415 Unsupported Media Type
The 415 (Unsupported Media Type) status code indicates that the origin server is
refusing to service the request because the content is in a format not supported
by this method on the target resource.

The format problem might be due to the request's indicated Content-Type or
Content-Encoding, or as a result of inspecting the data directly.

If the problem was caused by an unsupported content coding, the Accept-Encoding
response header field (Section 12.5.3) ought to be used to indicate which (if
any) content codings would have been accepted in the request.

On the other hand, if the cause was an unsupported media type, the Accept
response header field (Section 12.5.1) can be used to indicate which media types
would have been accepted in the request.

15.5.17. 416 Range Not Satisfiable
The 416 (Range Not Satisfiable) status code indicates that the set of ranges in
the request's Range header field (Section 14.2) has been rejected either because
none of the requested ranges are satisfiable or because the client has requested
an excessive number of small or overlapping ranges (a potential denial of
service attack).

Each range unit defines what is required for its own range sets to be
satisfiable. For example, Section 14.1.2 defines what makes a bytes range set
satisfiable.

A server that generates a 416 response to a byte-range request SHOULD generate a
Content-Range header field specifying the current length of the selected
representation (Section 14.4).

For example:

HTTP/1.1 416 Range Not Satisfiable
Date: Fri, 20 Jan 2012 15:41:54 GMT
Content-Range: bytes /47022
Note: Because servers are free to ignore Range, many implementations will
respond with the entire selected representation in a 200 (OK) response. That is
partly because most clients are prepared to receive a 200 (OK) to complete the
task (albeit less efficiently) and partly because clients might not stop making
an invalid range request until they have received a complete representation.
Thus, clients cannot depend on receiving a 416 (Range Not Satisfiable) response
even when it is most appropriate.

15.5.18. 417 Expectation Failed
The 417 (Expectation Failed) status code indicates that the expectation given in
the request's Expect header field (Section 10.1.1) could not be met by at least
one of the inbound servers.

15.5.19. 418 (Unused)
[RFC2324] was an April 1 RFC that lampooned the various ways HTTP was abused;
one such abuse was the definition of an application-specific 418 status code,
which has been deployed as a joke often enough for the code to be unusable for
any future use.

Therefore, the 418 status code is reserved in the IANA HTTP Status Code
Registry. This indicates that the status code cannot be assigned to other
applications currently. If future circumstances require its use (e.g.,
exhaustion of 4NN status codes), it can be re-assigned to another use.

15.5.20. 421 Misdirected Request
The 421 (Misdirected Request) status code indicates that the request was
directed at a server that is unable or unwilling to produce an authoritative
response for the target URI. An origin server (or gateway acting on behalf of
the origin server) sends 421 to reject a target URI that does not match an
origin for which the server has been configured (Section 4.3.1) or does not
match the connection context over which the request was received (Section 7.4).

A client that receives a 421 (Misdirected Request) response MAY retry the
request, whether or not the request method is idempotent, over a different
connection, such as a fresh connection specific to the target resource's origin,
or via an alternative service [ALTSVC].

A proxy MUST NOT generate a 421 response.

15.5.21. 422 Unprocessable Content
The 422 (Unprocessable Content) status code indicates that the server
understands the content type of the request content (hence a 415 (Unsupported
Media Type) status code is inappropriate), and the syntax of the request content
is correct, but it was unable to process the contained instructions. For
example, this status code can be sent if an XML request content contains
well-formed (i.e., syntactically correct), but semantically erroneous XML
instructions.

15.5.22. 426 Upgrade Required
The 426 (Upgrade Required) status code indicates that the server refuses to
perform the request using the current protocol but might be willing to do so
after the client upgrades to a different protocol. The server MUST send an
Upgrade header field in a 426 response to indicate the required protocol(s)
(Section 7.8).

Example:

HTTP/1.1 426 Upgrade Required
Upgrade: HTTP/3.0
Connection: Upgrade
Content-Length: 53
Content-Type: text/plain

This service requires use of the HTTP/3.0 protocol.
